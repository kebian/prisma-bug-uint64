# Problem with using unsigned bigints with MySQL / MariaDB

[GitHub issue #14231](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/14231)

### Bug description

Prisma will create the correct native types for mariadb / mysql but there are still problems using unsigned bigints in Prisma because it attempts to force them in to signed 64 bit integers and then throws an error when it fails.


### How to reproduce

I made a [small git repo](https://github.com/kebian/prisma-bug-uint64) to demonstrate the problem.

Declare a simple scheme like this...

```
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Nft {
  id    String @id @default(uuid())
  price BigInt @db.UnsignedBigInt // The field is created as unsigned
}
```

And then actually try and insert a record with a price greater than the maximum signed int64 ...

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

const main = async() => {
    const db = new PrismaClient()
    // define a value greater than max i64
    const bigval = 32000000000000000000n

    // value is correctly printed by node
    console.log('bigval is', bigval)

    // This will throw a PrismaClientKnownRequestError error of P2033
    // Query parsing failure: A number used in the query does not fit into a 64 bit signed integer. Consider using `BigInt` as field 
    // type if you're trying to store large integers.
    await db.nft.create({ data: { price: bigval }})
}

main().catch(console.error)
```


It's correct, it doesn't fit in to a signed 64 bit integer but I'm trying to put it in to an _unsigned_ 64 bit integer.

### Expected behavior

The unsigned value should not be ranged checked within the signed range and the value should be written to the db table.

### Prisma information
```
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Nft {
  id    String @id @default(uuid())
  price BigInt @db.UnsignedBigInt // The field is created as unsigned
}
```
